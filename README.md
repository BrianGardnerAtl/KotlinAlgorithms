# Kotlin Algorithms

This will be a collection of algorithms from the Introduction to Algorithms book
implemented in Kotlin. These are meant as a learning excersise for both Kotlin,
algorithms, and testing.

This is currently in an Android project, even though it doesn't do anything with
Android. My eventual plan for the project is to add some visualizations of the
algorithms.
